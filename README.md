# BibleApp

## Introduction
  • This is a single page web application that allows a user to read the Bible in many different versions.
  • I made this app to demonstrate my experience with recent standards in JS, React, RESTful API design and implementation, CSS, and HTML.
    I also wanted to solidify my learning on the technologies used in the app.
  • In the process of turning an idea into an app I learned a lot about what I need to improve on:
      - MVC is what I am most eager to learn more about and gain more practice with as this project
        made clear that an organized and well planned system design is key to successful software development.

Thanks for spending some time to check out my project!
